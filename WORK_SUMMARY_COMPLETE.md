## 🔍 Sample Exercise Structure

### Example: ex150_function_review_project

**Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[package]
name = "ex150_function_review_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
```

**src/main.rs:**
```rust
// Exercise 150: Function Review Project
// TODO: Implement the functionality for this exercise

fn main() {
    println!("Exercise 150: Function Review Project");
    // TODO: Add your implementation here
}
```

**Result:**
```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ex150_function_review_project v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s)
     Running `target/debug/ex150_function_review_project`
Exercise 150: Function Review Project
```
